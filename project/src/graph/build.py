"""Assemble extracted claims into a point-in-time edge panel.

A claim is "issuer i's 10-K, filed on date d, named counterparty j". An *edge*
is that claim with a validity interval attached, so the graph can be asked what
it looked like on any past date without leaking the future.

The interval rule follows how 10-Ks actually work. Each annual filing restates
the issuer's material relationships, so a relationship disclosed in filing `k`
is treated as live from `filed_k` until the issuer's *next* filing lands. If the
next filing names it again the interval extends; if it does not, the edge
lapses. That handles ended relationships without needing to detect an ending,
which filings rarely state outright. An issuer's final filing gets a fixed
`max_age` tail rather than living forever.
